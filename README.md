# RISC-V Image Cookbook

The RISC-V Image Cookbook is meant to help users to spin Ubuntu based images
for hardware that is not yet supported by the Ubuntu distribution.

It will guide you through these steps of your project:

* Collect requirements
* Setup Launchpad
* Build packages
* Build the image
* Test the image

The generated documenation is hosted at
https://canonical-risc-v-cookbook.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/.

The continuous integration results are available at
https://github.com/canonical/risc-v-cookbook/actions/.
